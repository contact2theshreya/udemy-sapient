Deployment strategy - rolling update,canary ,blue green

If version1 with 4 replica is deployed in k8s cluster and now v2 came and if u donâ€™t follow any strategy then u remive v1 and its 4 replica now u install v2 with 4 copy so install and uninstall if it takes 10 min (service down for 10 min)

So use deployment strategy to reduce downtime

## Rolling update  - near zero downtime(Default strategy)
instead of uninstalling prev version , it will add by default 25% of new copy(r5) of v2 and hen r5 is ready it will replace r4 of v1
with r5 of v2

So version 1 iwith 3 copy is still serving traffic when we replace v2 replica with v4
1replica - 25%
Use redness probe in k8s to define when r5 is ready

Make 4 replica of nginix

do kubectl edit deploy and change image name of v2 and u wil see now rolling update has started and only one replica of v1 got terminated
