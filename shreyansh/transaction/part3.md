If T1 has taken shared loch then other transaction can also take shared lock a dn can only reda the value
But in case of exclusive lock no other transaction can either read or write
Rd uncommited is only useful for Read application
Range lock means have taken lock in range of numbers,if lets say Rd has happened for id>0 and <5 then range lock will be taken for row with id 0-5
