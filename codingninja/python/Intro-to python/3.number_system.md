lly in decimal 20 means repat 0 for 2nd time 

10 - repaet 0 for 1st time

even number - last bit will be zero

if u remove last bit no will get divided by 2

lly 5-101 remove last bit 5/2 - 2-10

for 6 - last bit os zero and remaining bit is same as binary(3) as we dont know binary of 3 so will write its last bit and will now find binary(3/2) and so on

basically it's the procedure that we follow to convert decimal to binary
