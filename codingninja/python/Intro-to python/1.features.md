programming languages are of 2 types:

1) Low level - closer to machine so it's not written in proper englist so translator takes less steps to convert to machine code ex - c,c++,assemby (code inside chip)

2) HLL - opposite of LLL (python,ruby)

3) <img width="560" height="356" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03d6a32c-4e6e-4c31-aff4-3a7d3594132a" />
