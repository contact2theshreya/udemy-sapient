Applications-desktop application like antivirus,notepad using library (QT) , web apps(BE logic)

pyhon also supports FE code, AI and ML and we can do all these with python coz it is open source(code is available u can use it for free and modify same)

computer only understands binary coz it is electronic,elictricity pass on state

programming languages are of 2 types:

1) Low level - closer to machine so it's not written in proper englist so translator takes less steps to convert to machine code ex - c,c++,assemby (code inside chip)

2) HLL - opposite of LLL (python,ruby)

3) <img width="560" height="356" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03d6a32c-4e6e-4c31-aff4-3a7d3594132a" />

Translator is compiler where u give your code,it checks for error first

Any language does not need to have only one associated compiler like jnu compiler for c++

Compilesr - reads all code at once then convert if no errors wherease interpreter do not rd all at once it does line by line execution and rding , if line 3 has error it will throw error and stops
if this would have been case then compiler has never exectud line 1&2 coz it analyzed whole code at once and if there is a single rror it never executes

every programing language has own compiler and interpretor

Bash is interpreted language

## PYTHON 

python ,java,js depends on compiler and interpretor, some part of execution is done through copiler and some part of execution is done through interpretor

Python has diff flavour - cpython,jpython(java),pypython

In cpython version reading of bytecode happens through a process called as PVM(python VM), it reads byte code like interpretor and does execution coz of platform independent

PVM converts byte code to machine code, when u install python it install pvm,compiler

if .pyc file is create and if u compiled same byte code then it will not create same pyc file agin

.pyc file is located in __pycache__ folder location in pC,jpython uses JVM
