DOCKER NETWORKING
Docker networking is the system that allows Docker containers to communicate with each other, with the Docker host, and with the outside world. It uses various network drivers and Linux kernel features (like network namespaces and virtual interfaces) to provide network isolation and connectivity for containerized applications. 

Launch busybox image in container and u came inside busybox
U can then type ping google.com to check connectivity inside that container and my machine ip internet is routed to conatiner

Creating a custom bridge network allows your containers to communicate directly with each other by name through DNS resolution, making it simpler to manage connections without explicit links. Additionally, it enhances security by keeping your application components isolated, reducing the risk of interference from other containers.
