Conatinerizartion – utilizing all hardware by using many apps not juct one in one OS
Hypervisor manages all resources on computer, it's a software where i can divide H/w into diff isolated environment so that i can use more resources
Engine(docker) is faster than hypervisor
Hypervisor is VM

Container vs VM
can spin(switch b/w) containers faster unlike VM where installing OSS also takes time

Consistency - runs same in all env and os so portability also there

Docker  run – pull bvinary + run
If u delete running contatiner then images wont get deleted

with same image we can run as many containers where each container has unique id
docker ps - list all running container
docker ps -a - list all container
docker remove <container _id>
before removing images,remover aits all reference where it is being used ex from all container
docker images//list all image
docker rmi image_id//remove images
docker run -d <image name> - run in detached mode(background process) as terminal is busy
docker exec -it<container _id> <locn to run the container> - excute command withinn container
docker run -it <container_name> image name ///
