tree shakable provider - service will be bundled only if it is used,component must be also used somewhere
In Angular, the @Injectable decorator is used to define a service class that can be injected into components or other services. The providedIn property within the @Injectable decorator specifies where the service should be provided (or registered) in the dependency injection system.
Using @Injectable with providedIn: 'root'
When you use providedIn: 'root', the service is registered with the root injector, making it a singleton and available throughout the application without needing to explicitly add it to any module's providers array.
Typescriptimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', // Service is available application-wide
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {
    console.log('MyService initialized');
  }
}

Using @Injectable with providedIn: 'any'
If you use providedIn: 'any', the service is provided in all injectors. A new instance of the service is created for each lazy-loaded module, but the same instance is shared within eagerly loaded modules.
Typescript@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'any', // New instance for lazy-loaded modules
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {
    console.log('MyService initialized');
  }
}

Using @Injectable with providedIn: SomeModule
You can also specify a specific module in the providedIn property. This ensures the service is only available in that module's injector.

Service Definition:

Typescript@Injectable({
  providedIn: MyModule, // Service is scoped to MyModule
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {
    console.log('MyService initialized');
  }
}


Module Declaration:

Typescriptimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { MyService } from './my-service.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [],
})
export class MyModule {}

Key Benefits of providedIn

Tree Shaking: Unused services are removed during production builds, optimizing the app size.
Simplified Configuration: No need to manually add services to the providers array in modules.
Scoped Instances: You can control the scope of the service by specifying where it should be provided.

By using providedIn, Angular ensures efficient dependency injection while giving you flexibility in how services are shared across your application.
