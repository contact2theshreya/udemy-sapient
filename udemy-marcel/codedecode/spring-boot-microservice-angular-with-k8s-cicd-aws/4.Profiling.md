on cloud - eureka url should be of k8s pod of cloud
push image to docker hub so that when we deloy this to cloud ,cloud should be able to pull image,create ontainer,create pod,create deployment

docker build -t ----:latest//defining tagf name
docker oush the above image of all microservice by doing same change to dockerhub

when u loadbalanced application u might find unknown host exception for eureka-0 coz there can be multiple pods and to figure out which ip address to connecxted to will be difficult task for load balancer so use preferipaddress true for easy dns resoluytion

after profiling , push images to docker hub  of al BE service
now create aws eks cluster and push image to this using deployment files of k8s

Take eureka address from k8s pod and k8s pod will use your docker image of eureka
In k8s config file u can define env variable
