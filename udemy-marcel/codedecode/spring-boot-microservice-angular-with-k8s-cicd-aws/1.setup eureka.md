To avoid joining mutiple table based on key in sql, u can use mongodb and place all information in one json to avoid joining

Add @Document to create mongodb table
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Document("order")
public class Order {
    private Integer orderId;
    private List<FoodItemsDTO> foodItemsList;
    private Restaurant restaurant;
    private UserDTO userDTO;

}
Also note that seq table is not autogenerated in mongodb like sql so for that make sequence entity with id and sequence field and manke sequencegenerator class to increment sequence of the document

Refer thsi for mongodb table - https://github.com/udemy-dev-withK8s-AWS-codedecode/order-service/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codedecode/order/entity/Order.java
