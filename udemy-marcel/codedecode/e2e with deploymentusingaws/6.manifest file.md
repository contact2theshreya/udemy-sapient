manifest file used to craete infrastructure on EKS cluster

Deployment - not holding state so on restart pod the name changes that's why we use statful state in eureka
steful state - holds state,name should not change evn if pod restarts

labels,containername is used for categorization

Note if u hva eproperties and deployment file then preference will be given to deployment fule

if u don't give type of service then it will be bydefault - clisterIp

u cant go directly in aws cluster and run any cmd so do port fwd to local - kubectl port forward service_name:8761:8761
if u assign clusterip to eureka that means u are not able to hit eureka service from outside,if u try to hit 8761 in local u won't be able to do that

Now to make this work in your local u need to port forward it so that appliocation in eks cluster will be redirected to localhost 8761
after port fwd u can run any cmd of kubectl to check aws service cluster in local
