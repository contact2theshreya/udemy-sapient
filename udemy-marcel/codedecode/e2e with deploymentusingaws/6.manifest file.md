manifest file used to craete infrastructure on EKS cluster

Deployment - not holding state so on restart pod the name changes that's why we use statful state in eureka
steful state - holds state,name should not change evn if pod restarts

labels,containername is used for categorization

Note if u hva eproperties and deployment file then preference will be given to deployment fule

if u don't give type of service then it will be bydefault - clisterIp

u cant go directly in aws cluster and run any cmd so do port fwd to local - kubectl port forward service_name:8761:8761
if u assign clusterip to eureka that means u are not able to hit eureka service from outside,if u try to hit 8761 in local u won't be able to do that

Now to make this work in your local u need to port forward it so that appliocation in eks cluster will be redirected to localhost 8761
after port fwd u can run any cmd of kubectl to check aws service cluster in local 

To push manifest files to an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, you can follow these steps. This process involves applying Kubernetes manifest files (YAML files) to your EKS cluster using kubectl. Here's a concise guide:

Steps to Push Manifest Files to EKS Cluster


Ensure Prerequisites:

Install and configure the AWS CLI.
Install kubectl and ensure it matches your EKS cluster version.
Configure kubectl to connect to your EKS cluster:Bashaws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>





Prepare Your Manifest Files:

Create or edit your Kubernetes manifest files (e.g., deployment.yaml, service.yaml) to define the resources you want to deploy.



Apply the Manifest Files:

Use the kubectl apply command to push the manifest files to your EKS cluster:Bashkubectl apply -f <manifest-file.yaml>


To apply multiple files in a directory:Bashkubectl apply -f <directory-path>





Verify Deployment:

Check the status of your resources:Bashkubectl get all


For detailed logs of a specific pod:Bashkubectl logs <pod-name>






Example Manifest File (deployment.yaml):
YamlapiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


This will deploy your application to the EKS cluster. If you need advanced customization, tools like Kustomize or Helm can simplify managing complex deployments.
